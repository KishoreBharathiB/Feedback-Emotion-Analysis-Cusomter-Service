# Text Emotion Detection using NLP

This project is aimed at detecting the emotions in text using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms. The system allows you to classify the emotions in any text entered by the user. The model leverages **Logistic Regression** and a custom pipeline for text processing, along with various visualizations like **WordClouds** and **Probability Charts** to make the results more insightful.

## Features

- **Emotion Classification**: Classifies text into various emotional categories such as anger, happiness, joy, sadness, fear, etc.
- **Real-time Prediction**: Users can input text and instantly receive predictions for the emotion expressed in the text.
- **WordCloud Visualization**: Visualizes the emotional keywords in the text using a **WordCloud** to help users understand the prominent words that influenced the classification.
- **Prediction Probability**: Displays a **probability distribution** of each emotion for the given text, showing the confidence levels of the model in predicting different emotions.
- **Interactive Interface**: Built using **Streamlit** for an easy and interactive user experience.
